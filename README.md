# What is Pygame-Multiplayer?
This is a project where I re-created Pong in Python using the Pygame module. This version of Pong only supports multiplayer between 2 clients connecting to a local server. 

# Prerequisites
..* Latest version of Python 3!:
    
    To check if you have the right version of python3 run this command:
    python3 --version
    
    If you don't have it installed run this command:
    sudo apt-get install python3.6
..* Latest version of Pygame:
    
    To check if you have pygame installed run this:
    python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
    
    If nothing runs then you need to download pygame using this command:
    python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
